      <p> AESL initially came to be known as AESC when consultancy services were separated from the Public Works
        Department (PWD) under NRCD 193, 1973. As a government corporation, AESC became the sole consultant for public
        works. The company was later restructured by an act of parliament, ACT 461 Statutory Corporation (Conversion to
        Companies).
