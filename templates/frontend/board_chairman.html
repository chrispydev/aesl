                In 2019 your company operated in a domestic condition
                  that witnessed a real GDP growth of 6.5% from 6.3% in
                  2018. This was on the back of subdued inflation rate at
                  the end of the year at 9.6% from the 9.4% during the
                  year end 2018. This was a reflection of the tight
                  monetary policy measures implemented during that year. A
                  budget deficit of 4.8% of GDP amounting to GH¢ 3.69
                  billion was recorded in 2019 (as revenue amounted to GH¢
                  58.9 billion against an expenditure of GH¢ 41.6 billion
                  in 2018). There was a deterioration in the trade balance
                  with an overall balance of payments deficit on cash
                  basis of GH¢15.7 billion representing 4.5% of GDP 2019.
                  The Cedi eventually depreciated by 12.9% in 2019.
                  Anxiety about the upcoming 2020 election led to a
                  general “wait and see” attitude on the part of investors
                  and businessmen, both local and foreign. The Election
                  was viewed as a success by the International Community
                  because it did not result in violence and civil strife.
                  This was the economic environment in which your Company
                  operated in 2019.
